    <h3>Tableau Site Discovery</h3>
    <p>
      Tableau Site is an analytics platform for users to publish their dashboards and share insights. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Users have access to only contents that they are granted permissions to by content owners. This means that they would not be aware of potentially similar contents present on this site. This also means that they would not know who to look for if they wish to request access to a desired content.
    </p>
    <p>
      By tapping on metadata drawn from the Tableau site and presenting them in an interactive UI, it enables creators to identify opportunities for collaborations and users to direct their access requests to content owners with certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data obtained from personal Tableau Online site.

    <h3>BTS Lyrics</h3>
    <p>
      Ever felt like listening to songs with lyrics that convey an emotion you're feeling? 
    </p>
    <p>
      This project attempts to use zero-shot classification to assign probability of pre-defined emotions for 230 BTS song lyrics. Input a pre-defined emotion and songs with descending probability of this emotion are returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pre-defined emotions used are: happy, confident, sad, fearful, angry, nervous. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide more flexibility, the input emotion need not be from the pre-defined list. Zero-shot classification can be used to classify this input emotion as a pre-defined emotion and the returned songs follow.

    <h3>RegEx Away!</h3>
    <p>
      Put your regular expression knowledge to test!
    </p>
    <p>
      This project attempts to use regular expression to extract location information from 2,409 log files and generate a plot using these information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adapted from a challenge that I co-created for an outreach event* in May 2022.

    <h3>Kpop Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Explore the kpop entertainment world - groups, idols, music videos!
    </p>
    <p>
      This project attempts to draw insights on 299 kpop groups that debut between Sep 1995 and Apr 2020, (WIP) 1,252 korean idols born between Dec 1977 to Aug 2005, and (WIP) 3,772 korean music videos released between Mar 1992 to May 2020.
    </p>
    <p>For groups, the following were explored:
      <ul>
        <li>Debut Activity - the "When" and "How Frequent" questions over time</li>
        <li>Group Size vs Years since Debut - which is the most attractive quadrant in the scatterplot and how to interpret it?</li>
      </ul>

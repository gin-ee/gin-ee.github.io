    <h3>Tableau Site Discovery</h3>
    <p>
      Tableau Site is an analytics platform for users to publish their dashboards and share insights 📊. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Users have access to only contents that they are granted permissions to by content owners. This means that they would not be aware of potentially similar contents present on this site. This also means that they would not know who to look for if they wish to request access to a desired content. 😕
    </p>
    <p>
      By tapping on metadata drawn from the Tableau site and presenting them in an interactive UI, it enables creators to identify opportunities for collaborations and users to direct their access requests to content owners with certainty. 🤝🏼
    </p>
    <p>
      Data obtained from personal Tableau Online site. 🚀

    <h3>BTS Lyrics</h3>
    <p>
      Ever felt like listening to songs with lyrics that convey an emotion you're feeling? 🎧🎶
    </p>
    <p>
      This project attempts to use zero-shot classification to assign probability of pre-defined emotions for 230 BTS song lyrics. Input a pre-defined emotion and songs with descending probability of this emotion are returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pre-defined emotions used are: happy, confident, sad, fearful, angry, nervous. 😁😉🥺😨😡🥴
    </p>
    <p>
      To provide more flexibility, the input emotion need not be from the pre-defined list. Zero-shot classification can be used to classify this input emotion as a pre-defined emotion and the returned songs follow.

    <h3>Analysis of Stack Overflow data</h3>
    <p>
      Project aims to answer the following questions:
      <ul>
        <li>User Activity (Questions) - when are users actively posting questions?</li>
        <li>Word Cloud - what do users usually ask?</li>
        <li>Question Similarity - what are similar questions with replies that users who posted a question can refer to?</li>
        <li>User Activity (Answers) - when do users actively answer questions?</li>
        <li>Reply Duration - how fast can a user expect answers to his/her question?</li>
        <li>(WIP) Answers Sentiment - what is the general sentiment of the community of users who replied?</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>HR Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      Simple analysis of HR data to discover insights on recruitment related questions. 👀
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranking recruitment sources - why not? Sources with high returns and cost efficient? Even better. 🔥 Various metrics are created for this ranking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranking recruitment managers? Hmmm... 🤔😎 Using metrics to rank recruitment managers is indisputable. Numbers, when interpreted objectively, don't lie. Multiple metrics are carefully created with purpose of reflecting one's true ability. To provide more flexibility, varying importance of each metric in scoring is introduced.

    <h3>Data Labeling Platform</h3>
    <p>
      Looking to evaluate algorithms or fine-tune models? Some amount of labeled data is necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Been labeling data on shared excel files? Or separating unlabeled data only to compile them back after labeling? Or sending files via communication channels and getting confused who has completed their labeling? 😅💦 Can data labeling be done better? 🤔
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a common platform to perform data labeling? Wave goodbye to messy excel files! 👋
    </p>
    <p>
      Ingest users' labeling activities directly into a database? Use this data to draw immediate insights 🔎 and make targeted actions 🎯, all on the same platform!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sufficient labeled data? Perhaps it's time to evaluate your models/algorithms! Growing labeling conflicts? Perhaps it's time to refine label definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For purpose of this project, 100 COVID-19 related text snippets in various languages were obtained. And fasttext's language identification model was used to predict the language of these text snippets.
